Hello! Thanks for checking out my sleep trivia script!

This is my second bash script, and this is a nicer version of my other trivia script. The only difference between that one and this one are a few things
1. The questions are all different
2. There are a few ASCII photos in the text which make it look nicer
3. For every question wrong 30 seconds are added to the sleep timer

The sleep timer will be ran at the end of the script. The longer the sleep value is, the longer the user will have to wait for the script to terminate
itself, allowing them to return to whatever they were doing beforehand.

This script was designed for a graduate student cybersecurit class aswell as for GDDC, a hackathon hosted by my university. I hope you are entertained
by this one as I had a lot of syntax errors since this only my second bash script. Thankfully it was very similar to my other script so it was the same
format for the most part, just made it look nicer and instead of a scorebaord which acted as a grade, its a sleep timer. If you get all the questions wrong
you gotta wait 4 minutes which is pretty funny.

At the end of the script I commented out the ability for this file to remove itself so the user will not be able to find the script afterwards and see what
it did. If you want this to happen, then go to the very last like and just remove the #. Also make sure the path is proper, I wrote it assuming that the file
was stored in ~/Pictures.

Please don't use this for malicious purposes. I don't know why someone would, but I feel like I have to include this.
